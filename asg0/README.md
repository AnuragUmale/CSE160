# Project Overview

This project involves creating a web application that visualizes vector operations using a 2D canvas. The application leverages the `cuon-matrix.js` library to handle vector operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, normalization, and calculation of magnitude. It also features computation of angles between vectors and the area of a triangle formed by two vectors. This application is designed to help users interactively explore vector mathematics through graphical representations and real-time computations.

## Features

1. **Vector Drawing**: Users can input x and y coordinates to draw vectors on a canvas.
2. **Operation Visualization**: Supported operations include:
   - **Add**: Sum of two vectors.
   - **Subtract**: Difference between two vectors.
   - **Multiply and Divide**: Scalar multiplication and division of vectors.
   - **Normalize**: Normalizes vectors.
   - **Magnitude**: Computes the magnitude of vectors.
   - **Angle Between**: Calculates the angle between two vectors.
   - **Area**: Computes the area of the triangle formed by two vectors.
3. **Interactive Input**: Users can specify vector coordinates and select operations through input fields and dropdown menus.
4. **Real-time Results**: Operations' results are shown on the canvas and relevant computations (like magnitude, angle, and area) are printed in the browser's console.

### How to Use and Check Results

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
   - Clone the project repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Open the `asg0.html` file in your browser to launch the application.

3. **Drawing Vectors**:
   - Enter the x and y coordinates for the vector in the provided input fields and click the "Draw Vector" button to visualize the vector on the canvas.

4. **Performing Operations**:
   - To perform operations, input values for a second vector and select the desired operation from the dropdown menu.
   - Click the "Perform Operation" button to see the result both visually on the canvas and numerically in the browser's console (for magnitude, angle, and area).

5. **Visual Feedback**:
   - The canvas will update in real-time showing the initial vectors and any resulting vectors or outcomes of the chosen operations.
   - For magnitude, angle, and area calculations, check the browser console to view the printed results.

This application provides an engaging way to learn about vector operations and their geometrical interpretations, making it suitable for educational purposes or anyone interested in mathematics or computer graphics.
