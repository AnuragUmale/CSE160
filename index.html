            This project is a web-based application designed to visualize and interact with vector operations on a 2D canvas. Utilizing the cuon-matrix.js library, it facilitates the manipulation of vectors through operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, normalization, and magnitude calculation.
            Additionally, it offers features to compute angles between vectors and determine the area of a triangle formed by two vectors.
            The application aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for users interested in exploring vector mathematics. Users can input vector coordinates directly through a user-friendly interface, choose vectoroperations from dropdown menus, and see the results of these operations displayed both graphically on the canvas and numerically in the browserâ€™s console.
            Key functionalities include real-time graphical representation of vectors, interactive input fields for vector data, and immediate visual feedback on operations performed. This setup not only enhances understanding of vector concepts but also serves as a practical tool for anyone studying or working with mathematics or computer graphics.
            By offering an intuitive and interactive environment, the project makes complex vector operations accessible and engaging, ideal for educational purposes or as a resource for professionals in related fields.

            The WebGL Paint Application assignment requires students to develop an interactive web-based painting program using WebGL. The application must allow users to draw geometric shapes (points, triangles, and circles) on a canvas through clicking and dragging operations, with customizable features controlled through UI elements including RGB color sliders, brush size adjustment, and circle segment count. The implementation needs to follow proper code organization with specific functions for WebGL setup, GLSL variable connections, and shape rendering, utilizing an object-oriented approach for shape management. The final component involves creating a hand-drawn reference picture using at least 20 triangles and implementing it programmatically using WebGL, while maintaining integration with the existing painting functionality. Students progress through 12 structured steps, starting from basic WebGL canvas setup and advancing to complex features like custom shape rendering and performance optimization.

            This assignment involves creating and animating a 3D animal in WebGL by composing simple geometric primitives (e.g., cubes, spheres) into a hierarchical model. Users can interact with the model through sliders or mouse events to rotate, scale, and animate various limbs and joints. Depth testing and a structured matrix stack ensure each part stays correctly positioned while moving, providing a fun demonstration of 3D transformations and real-time rendering.

            This project involves creating a Minecraft-inspired 3D virtual world using WebGL, where players navigate through a customizable 32x32x4 voxel-based environment using first-person perspective controls. The world features textured cubes forming walls of varying heights, a ground plane, and a surrounding skybox, with core functionality including WASD keyboard movement, mouse-based camera rotation, and interactive block manipulation. Built using WebGL for 3D rendering, the project implements essential graphics programming concepts such as texture mapping, perspective projection, and camera systems, while also incorporating custom elements like terrain features or animated animals. Players can explore and modify the procedurally generated world, which is defined through a programmable 2D array, with the option to include basic gameplay or storytelling elements, all while maintaining a performance target of 10+ FPS in the full environment.
